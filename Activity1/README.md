# Array, For, If - Activity

### 1. Number Count using Array
Write a program to find the number of times a particular number occurs in a given input
array.

Include a function named findElementCount that accepts 3 arguments and returns an int. 

The first argument is the input array, the second argument is an int that corresponds to the size of the array and the third argument is the element to be searched for. 

The function returns an int that corresponds to the number of times the search element occurs in the array.

If the size of the array is negative or if any element in the array is negative, print “Invalid Input” and terminate the program.

### 2. Find the Greater id
Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Given an input array first Index indicates the cricketer’s id and second index indicates the score and so on...

Find out the cricketer's id who scored more than given score


Input and Output Format :

First line of input consists of n, the number of elements. Next n lines correspond to the array
elements.

The next line of the input consists of an integer that corresponds to the given score.

Output consist of an integer array, which contains cricketer's id who have scored more than
the given score.

1) Print "Invalid array size" when size of the array is negative and terminate the program .

2) Print "Invalid input" when there is any negative numbers available in the input array and
terminate the program.

3) Print "Invalid score" when the score is negative.

Include a function named findCricketerId(int array[], int size, int score) whose return type is
void.

The output array is stored in a global variable named cricketer.
