# Array, For, If - Activity

### 1. Number Count using Array
Write a program to find the number of times a particular number occurs in a given input
array.

Include a function named findElementCount that accepts 3 arguments and returns an int. 

The first argument is the input array, the second argument is an int that corresponds to the size of the array and the third argument is the element to be searched for. 

The function returns an int that corresponds to the number of times the search element occurs in the array.

If the size of the array is negative or if any element in the array is negative, print “Invalid Input” and terminate the program.
